## What is Cpchain?
CPChain is a new distributed infrastructure for next generation IoT. CPChain intends to build a fundamental data platform for IoT systems in combination with distributed storage, encryption computation and blockchain technologies, providing the whole process solution from data acquisition, storage, sharing to application.

CPChain is a promising solution to a series of challenges of the current "chimney architecture" of IoT systems, reducing connectivity cost of devices, protecting data privacy and maximizing the value of IoT data.

```
There are two modes to start this website , through http or socket(default):
```shell
./uwsgi_reload.sh http

[uwsgi-static] added mapping for /static => ./static
Now You can access http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```


### Note:

For testing Cpchain API functions, it would be best to setup a private network on your local machine using the <a href="http://docs.cpchain.io/deployment/deployment.html#download-docker" target="_blank">CPCHAIN Docker Guide</a>. The Docker guide sets up a Full Node and Event Server on your machine. 
You can then deploy smart contracts on your network and interact with them via CPChainWeb.
