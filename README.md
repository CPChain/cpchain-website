## What is CPChain?
CPChain is a new distributed infrastructure for next generation IoT. CPChain intends to build a fundamental data platform for IoT systems in combination with distributed storage, encryption computation and blockchain technologies, providing the whole process solution from data acquisition, storage, sharing to application.

CPChain is a promising solution to a series of challenges of the current "chimney architecture" of IoT systems, reducing connectivity cost of devices, protecting data privacy and maximizing the value of IoT data.
